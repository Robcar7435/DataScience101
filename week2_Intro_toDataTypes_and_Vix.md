### Week 2 Day 1 Data Understanding
    + CRISP DM Review
    + Tableau Installation
    + loading data with Tableau
#### Key Data Concepts:
+ Grainularity  (grain) (level of detail)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity
+ primary key (unique identifier)
+ instances (rows)
+ attributes (columns
+ filtering, slicing (selecting or removing rows from the data set)
+ ordering (changing the order of rows of the data set)
+ aggregation (summarizing data using a function such as sum or mean)
 
 #### Data Types
 + catagorical (cat, dog, mouse_
 + numeric:
    * integer 1,2 ,2 3
    * continous (floating) 1.12321, 1.123312 
 + ID (every element is unique, representing a primary key)
 + ordinal (ordered like grade A > B > C > D)
 + text (tweets, reviews, ect ...)
 + Dates, Datetimes, and times
 + images, videos
 + boolian (logical) True, False
 
 
 ### Basic Data Transformation
 + aggregation (summarize data by keys
 + filtering (remove row or columns, by conditions )
 + pivoting (take one column, make each unique value it's own column.)
 + unvipoting (exploding/ melting, taking combining columns into rows)
 + joining (combine data sets by keys)

### Week 2 Day 1 Data Understanding
    + Indroction to Weka
    + Indruction to Machine Learing
        + supervised (outcomes known)
        + unsupervised (out comes unknown)
        + other methods
    + Weka demonstration with IRIS Data Set

### Homework
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv

write a paragraph on why your chosen major using 538 recent college grads data set (linked above)
was a good or a poor choice given it's earning potential and employment rates,
support with plots in tableau (pasted int the a word document).  Advanced students may also use weka to create
  predictive models to support their conclusion.If you exact major was not listed, just
the most similar.  Answer the following: What are the weakness and advantages of using this particular dataset
and methodology in picking a major
