### Syllabus

#### Data Science 101, College of Charleston

Spring 2020

#### Official Course Description

Introduction to the use of computer based tools for the analysis of large data sets for the purpose of knowledge discovery. Students will learn to understand the Data Science process and the difference between deductive hypothesis-driven and inductive data-driven modeling. Students will have hands-on experience with various on-line analytically processing and data mining software and complete a project using real data.

##### Required Text

There is no required textbook to purchase for this course, but there will be a lot of required reading and online tutorials and guides.
