## DATA Science 101 Final Exam

#### Directions
Copy the markdown docuoment, provide a short answer underneith the questions, upload final exam to Oaks by May 2, 2019

Describe how your team used each step of the CRIPS DM Process for you final project.  ( A new sentences per step)


+ Business understanding



+ Data understanding



+ Data preparation



+ Modeling



+ Evaluation



+ Deployment



##### 

+ In the modeling phase of your project, how was the data split 


+ What is the difference between 10 fold cross validation and a random holdout when splitting data? Why would you use one vs the other?




+ How to decision tree use entropy to decide where to split variables?




Define the following parts of a decision tree: 

+ root:


+ node: 


+ leaf: 

#### Understanding Classication Models
The following are error metrics of predictive models of a severely imbalanced data set:

+ model1: training-set: accuracy 99.9%, auc 0.5, test-set: accuracy 99.9%, auc 0.5
+ model2: training-set: accuracy 60% auc .6, test-set: accuracy 99.9%, auc 0.5
+ model3: training_set: accuracy 95% auc .92, test_set: accuracy 75.9%, auc 0.63
+ model4: training_set: accuracy 92% auc .85, test_set: accuracy 91%, auc 0.83


 * Which model is under fit?

 * Which model is over fit?

 * Which model learned a trivial, non intersting, solution?
 
 * Which is the best model?

#### regression Models

+ Why would you choose mean squared (MSE) as a regression metric vs MAE (mean average error)?

+ A model has been trained on a training set with 10,000 training set rows and 2,500 test set rows

+ Given the following performance metrics Which is the best decision tree model, and why?

  * model1: 500 leaves, training-set: mse 1.1, r2_score .86 , test-set: mse 3.3 r2_score .75
  * model2: 250 leaves, training-set: mse 3.4, r2_score .8 , test-set: mse 3.3, r2_score .81
  * model3: 100 leaves, training-set: mse 4.0, r2_score .75 , test-set: mse 4.0 r2_score .75


#### CLustering

+ When building cluster models, what are desirable features that a good model might demonstrate?  


+ Can a cluster model be over fit, if so how could you tell?


#### Data Mining Process

You work at a cell phone service provider that has a large problem customer retention (customers are switch to a rival cell provided in alarming rates). You have access to payment and account history of all your customer, as well as website visits and search histories.  Create a project proposal using CRIP DM as a frame work to use Data Science create a proposal of a project that will address the customer retention.
