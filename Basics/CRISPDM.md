#### Notes:
+ when installing python, make sure to check the box that adds python to the system path, this allows you to type 'python' or 'pip'
at the command prompt if done correctly.
+ For  windows installation it's better to put python in a C:/python folder than to let install in the default location
+ for some Mac and Linux systems, 'python3' command is used instead of python.
