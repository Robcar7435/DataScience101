## CRISP DM 
Cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM

RISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases[14]:

    
    The CRISP-DM process model has six major phases:
+ Business Understanding: Get a clear understanding of the problem you’re out to solve, how it impacts your organization, and 
+ Data Understanding: Inspect, describe and evaluate the available data.
+ Data Preparation: Take data from the state it’s in to the state needed for analysis.
+ Modeling: Use mathematical techniques to make models (equations or other logic) you can use to support business decisions.
+ Evaluation: Figure out whether your models are any good.
+ Deployment: Integrate models into everyday business.
